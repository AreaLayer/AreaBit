# AreaBit
Lending Bitcoin on RGB Network

# How works?

It defines a loan schema with borrower, lender, and amount fields, a loan contract with the defined schema, and loan metadata. It then generates a loan asset from the contract and metadata.

The borrower and lender addresses are generated using their public keys, and the borrower address is funded with 1 BTC.

Finally, the code generates three types of loan transitions: issuance, transfer, and redemption. The issuance transition issues the loan asset, the transfer transition transfers the asset from the borrower to the lender, and the redemption transition redeems the asset from the lender.
